	There are three buttons on the top of the logger remote: Left, Mode, Right
	or L, M, and R.
00:00:00 80%
3901' -40.3Â°F
00:00:00PM
	Info Mode:	If log is running the elapsed time is displayed and percentage
				remaining on line 1.
				The time on line 2.
				The altitude and temperature on line 3.
				Pressing M moves to log mode
	Log Mode:	if not running options are L "SWAP", R "START" on line 1
					Displays starting location name on line 2
					Displays starting location altitude on line 3
				if running options are L none, R "STOP"
				if paused/stopped, options are L "DONE", R "RESUME"
					Displays ending location name on line 2
					Displays ending location altitude on line 3
				If starting == ending loc, "START == END!" is displayed on
				line 1, and the LR buttons are disabled
				Pressing M when not running changes mode to to starting location
				selection mode.
				Pressing M when running changes the mode to info mode.
				
	Starting Location Selection Mode: Displays "START LOC" centered on line 1
				Displays current starting loc name on line 2
				Displays current starting loc altitude on line 3
				Pressing L moves to and selects previous location
				Pressing R moves to and selects next location
				Pressing M changes the mode to ending location selection mode
	Ending Location Selection Mode: Displays "END LOC" centered on line 1
				Displays current ending loc name on line 2
				Displays current ending loc altitude on line 3
				Pressing L moves to and selects previous location
				Pressing R moves to and selects next location
				Pressing M changes the mode to info mode
	Sync Mode:	You can't enter or leave sync mode by pressing mode when
				syncing.  Once the sync is successful pressing mode will move
				to info mode.
				
				When not synced and not syncing, "SYNC BMP" is displayed on
				line 1. "[LEFT] 2 SYNC" is displayed on line 3.
				
				When sync starts line 3 displays "SYNCING BMP"
				If successful line 2 displays "BMP SYNCD" and
				line 3 displays "[MODE] 2 EXIT"
				
	Handshaking with gateway: The gateway goes into receive mode immediately
				after receiving a packet from the BMP280.  The gateway stays in
				receive mode for up to 1/2 second.  If a remote packet arrives,
				meaning the remote is awake, the gateway will continuously stay
				in receive mode for 30 seconds after each packet is received.
				
				The remote receives a BMP280 packet.  If the remote is awake it
				will request synchronization data from the gatway.
